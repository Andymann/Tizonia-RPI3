# This file acts as an update mechanism.
# the first non-dashed line contains an ID
# if this id differs from the local copy
# a git clone is done on the machine in order
# to retrieve a new copy 
#
# There are several other ways. Reading the commit-id, for example.
# However this allows me to control the exact moment
# when an upgrade should be pulled.
#
# ID can be basically anything but something like
# a timestamp seems sensible.
